# Article 1 
In the Uri Gal's article [ChatGPT is a data privacy nightmare. If youâ€™ve ever posted online, you ought to be concerned](https://theconversation.com/chatgpt-is-a-data-privacy-nightmare-if-youve-ever-posted-online-you-ought-to-be-concerned-199283)
ChatGPT is an AI software that recently hit the shelves and reached 100 million active users within just two months of its release. Although the basic service of the software is for chatting, and of course it can provide you with data support, but behind these traversals is our private data being ruthlessly scraped, as long as you have left anything on the Internet can be used directly by chatGPT without authorization The chatGPT is a company that is not only a user, but also a user of the Internet.
chatGPT charges its users $20 per month, but never pays a single penny to the Internet users it scrapes. Information on the Internet is currently shared, but when chatGPT uses the integration of this information for profit it is an infringement, and it is likely that everyone is being infringed upon without even knowing it.

In the Krytal Hu's article [ChatGPT sets record for fastest-growing user base - analyst note](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/)
ChatGPT can generate articles, essays, jokes and even poems based on prompts. It can be used to help the public reduce information barriers and information cocoons to reduce time wastage. 
OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft Corporation (MSFT.O), was made available to the public for free in late November. The growing use, while imposing a huge computational cost on OpenAI, also provides valuable feedback to help train chatbots to respond.
